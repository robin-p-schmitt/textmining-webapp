### Textmining WebApp

This project is still at its very beginning. My goal is to build a web application in which users can explore different text mining techniques together with visualizations.

Currently, there only exists a single notebook, in which I am experimenting with visualizing clusters of word embeddings. The embeddings are trained on publicly available corpora like the Brown and Gutenberg corpora.
